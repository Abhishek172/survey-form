A working internet connection is mandatory to view all the properties and for the proper front-end functionality of the Survey form.
I have created the front-end of a survey form using HTML and CSS .
In my project , I have fixed the header and have given two ready to use functional buttons and have added hover on them to make it respond when the cursor is at the button.
In the form , I have made input boxes which accepts the values only true to the statement .
If I try to submit form without the extension of @xyz.com in email, it says incorrect email id format. Similar is the case with the contact no. box . It saves only when numeric value is entered.
A drop down box is there to select the event name and write the reviews about it.
Lastly , in the footer tag , I have given three buttons that once clicked it opens the platform mentioned.
